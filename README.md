<h1 align="center">Drofa</h1>

A UCI chess engine written in C++11.
Drofa uses AB-search and combines hand-crafted evaluation (HCE) with supplementary NN,
that uses King and Pawn (KPNN) positions as inputs (264 -> 16 -> 2).

This approach resulted in an engine of moderate strength.


## Origins
Drofa started as fork of the <a href="https://github.com/GunshipPenguin/shallow-blue">Shallow Blue</a> chess engine.
My initial intention was to take weak, but stable and working chess engine and try to improve it,
learning c++ along the way.

During my Drofa experiments huge chunk of knowlenge were received from:

 - <a href="https://github.com/peterwankman/vice">VICE</a> chess engine and tutorials.
 - <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org">Chessprogramming WIKI</a> great place for all chessprogramming-related knowledge.
 - <a href="https://github.com/TerjeKir/weiss">Weiss</a> chess engine, with clean and understandable implementations of complex features. Drofa use Weiss 1.0
LMP base reduction formulas. Althouth Adagrad tuning implementation is not copy-pasted from Weiss, Drofa implementation closesy follows Weiss logic and can be considered a c++ rewrite of it.
 - Several open source engines, mostly <a href="https://github.com/AndyGrant/Ethereal">Ethereal</a> and <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish">Stockfish</a>

Special thanks to:
 - Terje Kirstihagen (Weiss author)
 - Andrew Grant. AdaGrad paper and Ethereal chess engine are great sources of knowledge; Ethereal tuning dataset was a great help in tuning. As well as allowing me on main OpenBench instance
 - Kim Kahre, Finn Eggers and Eugenio Bruno (Koivisto team) for allowing Drofa on Koi OpenBench instance and motivating me to work on the engine
 - Jay Honnold (Berserk author) for helping me with NN stuff
 - OpenBench community for helping me with motivation, in finding bugs, teaching me (even if unknowingly) good programming practices and interesting discussions

## Strength (ccrl blitz elo) - as of May 2023:
```
Drofa 1.0.0    2088
Drofa 1.3.1    2424
Drofa 2.0.0    2488
Drofa 2.0.0    2488
Drofa 3.0.0    2922
Drofa 3.1.0    3009
Drofa 3.2.0    3101
Drofa 3.3.0    3188
Drofa 4.0.0    ~3250 - etimated based on 3.3.22 results
```

Since version 3.3.23 Drofa supports FRC and DFRC, with a CCRL elo of 3244

## Changelogs

With Drofa 4.0.0 many features was added on top of the Shallow Blue, adding up to more than 1000 elo.
Almost-full changelog with SPRT results and ELO estimations for most of the features can be found in `Changelogs` folder.


## UCI commands

Drofa 3.0.0 supports following UCI commands:

- BookPath
- OwnBook
- Threads (1 to 172),
- Hash    (16 to 65536)

These options can be set from your chess GUI or the UCI interface as follows:

```
setoption name OwnBook value true
setoption name BookPath value /path/to/book.bin
```

## License

I dont know shit about licensing and Drofa is too weak to be plagiarised.
So it is under the same MIT license as Shallow Blue.
